I am an engineer with a background in electronics and writing industrial software. I've worked on some pretty interesting projects througout my professional career and I'm eager to share the little I've learned. Currently, I'm with a London-based company, in the IoT space, working on transitioning their core system to a Linux-based platform, with increased security, ease of deployment and lower costs.

Most of the posts on this site will cover C#, C, embedded and industrial devices and security.
