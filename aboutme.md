I am an engineer with a background in electronics and control systems who loves tinkering with home-made servers, Linux and Raspberry Pis. I'm currently working on a real-time, high volume, mission-critical transport system that powers a big proportion of the U.K's public transport infrastructure.

Most of the posts on this site will cover C#, C, embedded and industrial devices and security.
