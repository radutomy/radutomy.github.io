I am an engineer with a background in electronics and writing industrial software. I've worked on some pretty interesting projects througout my professional career and I'm eager to share the little I've learned. I'm currently working on a real-time, high volume, mission-critical transport system that powers a big proportion of the U.K's public transport infrastructure.

Most of the posts on this site will cover C#, C, embedded and industrial devices and security.
