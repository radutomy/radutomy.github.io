I am an engineer with a background in electronics and writing industrial software. I've done some pretty interesting projects througout my professional career and I'm eager to share some of the knowledge. I currently work for a London-based company in the IoT space. I'm working on transitioning their core system to a Linux-based platform, with increased security, ease of deployment and lower costs.

Most of the posts on this site will cover C#, C, embedded and industrial devices and security.
