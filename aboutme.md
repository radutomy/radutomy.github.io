I am an engineer with a background in electronics and writing industrial software. I've worked on some pretty interesting projects througout my professional career and I'm eager to share the little I've learned. I'm currently working on a real-time, high volume, mission-critical transport system  transitioning their core system to a Linux-based platform, with increased security, ease of deployment and lower costs.

Most of the posts on this site will cover C#, C, embedded and industrial devices and security.
